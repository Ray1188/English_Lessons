One of the crowded place that i remember it's Hofbrahause in Munich.
It is(This one is) located in the centre of Munich, also known as the old town near MArienPlatz.
Hofb is surrounded by many other pub and restaurants.
All these places are saturated with the spirit of joy and fun.

I have planned to visit Munich and its famous pub many times.
I visited this place in 2017 with my friends during our trip to Europe.

That pub is not similar to other pubs. It's a big building with huge hall on the first floor and big columns
Not far from the entrance is a large bar with a wide range of beer.
Of a particular interest are the tables at which people drink beer. They were made from wood, looked like medieval times, 
with the names of people and cities were carved everywhere.

Nevertheless, when i found myself there, I felt better than i expected.
It is rare for one's current feeling to be better than thair expectation.
So My friends and I enjoyed gallons of beer and entertainment, surrounded a huge crowd of people.
A group of musicians played in the centre of the hall, sometimes taking few minutes to relax drunk beer before continue to played music.
They also had a beatifull tradition,(of walking around the hall) walked around the holle and people added up to them behind continuuing drinking and dancing.
It was one of the beatifull places what i have evere visited.
